# Basic-Python-Concepts
This repository contains two basic Python programs demonstrating user input, arithmetic operations, and string handling.

## Task 1: Arithmetic Operations

This program takes two integers as input and performs the following operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

CODE

a = int(input('Enter the first number: '))
b = int(input('Enter the second number: '))

c = a + b
print('Addition:', c)
d = a - b
print('Subtraction:', d)
e = a * b
print('Multiplication:', e)
f = a / b
print('Division:', f)


## Task 2: Personalized Greeting

This program takes the user's first and last name as input and prints a personalized greeting message.

CODE

a=input('Enter your first name: ')
b=input('Enter your last name: ')
c=('Hello, ')+ a+ " " +b+('! welcome to the python program.')
print(c)
